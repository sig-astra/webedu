      <p>Although it may seem as though they are not connected, business communications and tech skills are symbiotic in nature. To be a true professional, you cannot have only one or the other, but you should be adept in both. It is imperative to work toward mastering the hard tech skills in a desired field because these skills are the foundation of any career, resume, and professional. Without these hard tech skills, one can possibly get in the door or have people listen to them but couldn’t back it up. On the other hand, you have business communication skills. These are the skills that allow you to interact with other professionals in the corporate world, market yourself and get in the door or interview, and communicate effectively in your work environment. Furthermore, these skills are not static, it is not something you learn to do once or an achievement  you earn and never have to practice or maintain again. These skills are something you should always cultivate. Therefore, you cannot have one set of these skills without the other, you need both in order to flourish successfully.

      <p>So, where do TIM Talks come in? TIM Talks are offered online as a part of  a webucation so that anyone can access the necessary materials to strengthen both tech and business communication skills. Within the contents of our site you will find lessons covering on grammar, crafting a LinkedIn profile, network troubleshooting, and maintenence on the Windows 7 operating system. It is our hope that these lessons will help users grow and learn as both technicians and professionals. We aim to make the lessons easy to follow so that no matter what level of tech you are at, you will never get lost, feel overwhelmed, or be confused.  Admittedly, tech and business can get a bit boring, so we’ve tried to make this experience as fun for users as we had creating it. Enjoy. </p>
