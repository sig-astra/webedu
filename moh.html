      <p>I would describe myself as passionate, hard-working, intelligent, and fun. In my spare time, I enjoy creative writing, reading, and music. My first love was reading which I chose over video games and TV most of the time. I remember many occasions where my mother would chastise me to pay attention because I would read everywhere I went, even while walking. I have never confined myself to a particular or favorite genre because I believe in keeping myself open to learning from anyone and anywhere. I started exploring through different genres quite early on and soon found myself reading at a level many years beyond my age. My second love, which was came inseparably intertwined with reading, was poetry. I remember reading Shakespeare, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, and even Dr. Suess and Shel Silverstein and becoming enamored with the ability to mold words and describe myself and the world around me while only being limited to my imagination. As such, my second love, poetry, manifested though I cannot pin point exactly when; my earliest memory would be somewhere in elementary school. I soon grew out of rudimentary rhyme schemes and began creating deeper, more abstract pieces. And it was here that I started expanding my horizon. I found that sometimes I didn’t have enough room to express a thought through poetry, so I started writing spoken word, prose, and short stories. The last of my loves is music. I grew up hearing home-grown, south-side certified house music, jazz, and classics of the 60s, 70, and 80s eras. This provided the perfect foundation for me to explore through many realms of music with through the lens of true musicianship. Throughout the years I have put nearly every type of music, from alternative to grunge to 90s era rap and R&B to hip-hop to metal to EDM to future wave and everything in-between, in my collection. Recently, I have started to dabble in DJing and music production. As is probably evident, I am deeply invested in art, and I enjoy museums, galleries, and live performances. I welcome discussion on anything within the art realm, psychology, philosophy, literature, and nature. I am always open to trying new things, learning, and good conversation, so never hesitate to talk to me. </p>
      <p>Before I came to Year Up, I was working in the food service industry. I had a few years of college under my belt, but due to personal and financial hardships, I had to take some time off. My major is English in Secondary Education and my minor is Black Studies. Long term, I want to merge education and technology. I feel as though technology is just a tool and a tool is only as effective as we use it. I believe we can find better and supplemental ways of learning. So, I want to develop new apps, websites, and software to embark in new directions. During my time at Year Up, my focus has been in programming, and I am currently enrolled in Udacity pursuing my nanodegree. Though it is a bit of a different approach, I enjoy programming because I engage with it in the same way as language. With any language, you have strict syntax and rules for grammar, but within them you have free range of expression. To me, coding is like a language. I mean, it’s no coincidence that we call them programming languages. I engage with coding the same way that I engage with language, being that I have free range in creativity and expression so long as I stay within the confines of grammar and syntax. Yes, the minute technicalities of the rules can get a bit cumbersome, but the more you practice, the easier it becomes. When you code, you start off with a blank page and the possibilities are only limited to the amount of work that you put into it. I am looking forward to my upcoming internship where I hope to be able to expand upon my tech skills and gain experience to make myself more marketable and prepared for a career within the programming field. I would enjoy, but do not limit myself to, a position in front-end web development or app development. </p>
